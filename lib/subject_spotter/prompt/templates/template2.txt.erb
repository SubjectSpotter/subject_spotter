        - Identify words or phrases in the transcription that match subjects from the list.
        - Use the categorization and description to resolve ambiguity.
        - Wrap matched entities in <a> tags with:
            - `id` attribute set to the subject's ID.
            - `title` attribute set to the subject's title.
        - Do not modify the text except to add annotations.
